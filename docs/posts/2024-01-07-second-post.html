    <h2>Holidays</h2>
    <p>Dear Hana,</p>
    <p>I hope that you are having very nice days in Cuzco. 
	Yesterday, we came back from our holidays and we are still a bit tired. 
	The weather is cold and it is snowing, so it invites to relax and stay cozy at home. 
	Nothing compared to what the nice days should be in Peru, I imagine. </p>
	
	<p>Even when we are a bit tired, I am very satisfied of these days, since we could visit some cities, 
	I consider very nice and important to see at least once in a life time. 
	Especially for my father and brother who have not travelled too much before and who haven‚Äôt been in Europe very often, 
	this is their second time, while my mother is now in her fifth time üòä.  </p>
	
	<p>We actually had very intense days, walking and visiting interesting cities in just one days. 
	For example, we were in Rome just one day and we visited most of the popular places. 
	That means we really walk many thousands of steps in just day, which they are not totally used to. 
	But I am happy they are still strong enough to bare such experiences. Seeing such important and historic city in 
	one day gives you only a grasp of what actually can be offered, and the perception of the art, culture and history 
	may be limited and saturated. But I considered it good this way and take the chance we had already to make this visit. 
	One never knows in the future if another chance or availability could come again. Better now than maybe never, right?. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Besides this, we could gather very beautiful moments and anecdotes that for sure will last a lifetime. 
	It made me very happy this time that allowed me to enjoy with them new experiences but also understand how we 
	behave as family and how we could spend good and bad moments as well. The key is to understand not everything 
	is perfect and the satisfaction of more time being together doing something meaningful is highly rewarding. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Now that I am back at home, I start to think about the porpoises this new year may bring. 
	I thought about this during my holidays, and I identified some aspects in which I would like to focus on this year. 
	I would like to tell you a bit about this. Since, I will work mostly remotely, I consider that my extra working 
	activities should have high priority to adapt to this new working regime which I have not been exposed before.
	</p>

	<p>
	But I understand now that building communities is the most important. So, I would like to develop myself inside 
	different areas, and interact with people from which I could learn and share the experiences of different activities.
	This idea is now inside of me and I have the feeling that I should go deeper on it in different aspects. 
	I have some ideas which I may try this year, for example:  
	</p>

    <h2>Dancing</h2>
    <p>
	I experienced this last year while I danced Salsa for many months. 
	Where I did several courses and went regularly in the party gatherings. 
	So somehow, I recognized myself as part of a community there. 
	The time I spend dancing was so enjoyable that I don‚Äôt think I should limit this aspect in this year that it starts. 
	I felt and enjoyed so many things from dancing, that I believe this deserves an own entry in this blog. 
	So, in the future I will describe you more about this in another blog. 
	Meawhile I leave you here a song I always liked from my classes: 
	</p>

        <!-- Replace "images/salsa_01.mp4" with the actual path to your .mp4 file -->
        <source src="images/salsa_02.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </video>
    </div>

	
	<h2>Music</h2>
    <p>Maybe I told you about this, I was kind of a musician when young. 
	I did play the cornet, which is a similar instrument to the trumpet but without the ventiles for air. 
	It was funny because in Mexico, it is common to have music bands to perform civic ceremonies that honoured the flag etc.
	So the music played is more related to the military routines that honor the nations symbols. 
	The songs are more like melodies that serve to give orders during parades. 
	It was a funny time because I did it during the university to gain some sports credits and this activity was included. 
	I was attracted to the discipline and rigid aspect of the order of the band. 
	The music itself has its own charm. Here I leave you a video of a band performing some bands, 
	similar to what I did as well.
	</p>
	
	<p>Well, the idea is that knowing how to play the cornet, learning to play the trumpet should not be that difficult. 
	And one very nice thing is that Mariachis, the Mexican typical band of regional music, also needs trumpets. 
	Here in Munich there is one nice band that usually plays in the Mexican events, making the parties always happier. 
	And since this year, I got the invitation of one guy working in the band to play with them :) 
	Of course, I need to learn a decent repertoire of songs, lets say 5 or 10 for a beginning. 
	But then I would be able to play with them, which could serve as a very funny hobby as musician. 
	We could play in the many Mexican parties here in Munich, ir in different other events as weddings or other ceremonies. 
	Being a Mariachi has always been a funny project for me and now it seems to be not so far away. 
	I even have now a trumpet which I bought for a very fair price before leaving for holidays. 
	So practice is what should come next :) 
	Here you have some videos of various successful artists playing very famous Mexican songs with Mariachi. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Mente sana en cuerpo sano</h2>
    <p>Additionally, some physical activity is gonna be key in these time that is coming. 
	After the stressful situations of moving out from an apartment and many days in holidays, 
	somehow I miss some routine of exercises and regular eating. Focusing on working out brought me good mood 
	the last year as well. I could not do it so regular as I wished, but now I have the possibilities with some 
	fitness studies here close to where I live now. Additionally, there are courses of Yoga that are included in 
	the membership so it makes sense if I try this as well. I have never had a deep approach, but I do remember 
	the nice Turtle and Lizard you thought me and I think there should be many different rewarding postures to enjoy in it.
	Like the famous quote ‚ÄúHealthy mind in healthy body‚Äù. Maybe I could ask you a bit more about this in the future, Hana?. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Expressing inner feelings</h2>
    <p>I feel since many years I have so much to express and I have struggle to find a good way to conduct these needs 
	of expression using some form of art. Music is one of them of course, you know very well how much music means to me,
	but I also believe that other expressions like drawing or handwork can be very fulfilling. 
	I have not a very clear idea about it, but I do like architecture and drawing sketches of building is one of the 
	things I have in mind. I did a bit in my bachelor, but everything was on computer and not really focused on expressing 
	feelings or emotions, but more in a practical way. So drawing by hand some facades or perspectives of buildings could 
	be a good project, don‚Äôt you think so?. 
	</p>

	<p>Hand working with tools and doing some courses on goldsmith could fit as well to my ideas. 
	I have something for jewelry lately, I feel attracted to learn the building process of different rings, 
	necklaces or earrings and being able to create beautiful things with my hands and patience. 
	This could even serve as a side business, right? But of course, this is a faraway idea since to work on this 
	one needs a working place and many tools and some training on it. Maybe this year I will only scratch the surface 
	of this possibility, but is always nice to dream on it :)

	<h2>The most important</h2>
    <p>But I don‚Äôt want to make you believe only new things are on my head. 
	The most important thing is maybe my circle of friends I have here in Munich. It has evolved and changed, 
	but we are still almost all of us here and we continue to meet and making the friendship to last. 
	Working of keeping strong bounds and enjoying the special occasions with them is one of the main reasons of why 
	I decided to move. Being so far away from home and family, I feel so lucky to have such group of friends and the 
	possibility to live in the same city as them. Maybe it is a way in which I can feel a bit like home being far away 
	from Mexico. My very good friends you know and I hope you still remember them. But there are other good friends 
	which have come in the last years and others have changed and evolved. I am anyways happy to work and building good 
	experiences on these nice people. 
	</p>

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I keep on with the usual hobbies of reading and watching movies. 
	I did very few progress on these in the last year since I did not read many books or watched movies/went to the cinema. 
	But I did read a couple of very good books that gave too much to think and make reflections about life: 
	The Sttepenwolf and Oliver Twist. But maybe this is also topic of another entry in this blog since you may think 
	this entry is already a bit long.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Finalmente</h2>
    <p>I wish you then a pleasant Sunday and that all your thoughts and plans for the next year start in the better way. 
	I also wish that nice situations and good experiences come to your life unexpectedly and they bring you refreshing 
	happiness in normal days. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Wish you the best Hana, te pienso mucho,</p>
	<p>Leonardo.</p>
