        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi Hana, I am creating this blog as way of communicate many of the thoughts and ideas 
		that come to my mind for you. Most of them are spontaneous amd other are there in my mind for quite 
		some time already. I believe that a blog is a beatiful way to share them with you because I can focus
		on write and describe clearly for your enjoyment and understanding, and this helps to create a new way of 
		a communication between you and me, which is something I have been willing since long ago.</p>
		
		<p>I will create new post on a regular basis, so you can be attentive from time to time to notice some changes.
		Although I will let you know when something important happens in this blog. 
		The beatiful thing is that here, you will be able to read them any time you want as much as you want. 
		Meanwhile, you can have a look to the first post I already wrote for you. 
		I will inform you of future entries when they are ready :) </p>
